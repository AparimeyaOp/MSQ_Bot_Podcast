Projects
Sentient | Python, NextJS, TailwindCSS, ElectronJS, Neo4J, FastAPI, Langchain, Flower
Oct 2024 - Present
• Sentient is your personal and private AI with agents and memory. It is a fully local AI companion that features extensive
integrations with your favorite tools and memory that allows it to learn more about you over time.
• Sentient is a desktop app built with ElectronJS and Python and features a fully custom orchestrator-based pipeline for
agents and memory that we developed in-house. It also has additional features like internet search that allows Sentient to
query the web for any info it needs, with plans for many more features in the future.
• Sentient uses a personality test based on the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator to understand the personality of the user. This
is used along with data pulled from a user’s social media profiles to create a knowledge graph about the user. This graph
is maintained by Sentient and used to personalize responses.
• v1.3 of the app includes full integration with GSuite (Gmail, GDrive, GDocs, GSheets, GSlides, GCalendar), a custom
memory pipeline to create and maintain a knowledge graph about the user along with LinkedIn, Reddit and X
integrations to pull personal data about the user for profile creation.
• Sentient is available for download today - check out the website for a live web demo, download info, release pipeline and
more. sentient.app
Project Vaayu | Python, Jupyter Notebook, Image Segmentation, Machine Learning, PyTorch
Oct 2024 - Present
• Developed a UNet++ based solution for Image Segmentation of Drone Orthophotos for the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
• Worked with GIS data in software like QGIS. Designed and implemented a custom pipeline to generate training data for
image segmentation models from hi-resolution drone imagery and vector data.
• Successfully implemented and open-sourced the expected solution. Trained ML models for segmentation of buildings,
roads and water bodies from drone orthophotos.
• Project Vaayu is open source and can be viewed on GitHub. GitHub Repository
Bloomify | Python, NextJS, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, Docker, FastAPI, Vercel, Mistral, QLoRA
Feb 2024 - Present
• Developed a chatbot-based solution for assessment creation based on Bloom’s Taxononmy for modern educators.
• Features include - Classification of questions into their cognitive levels (Bloom’s Taxonomy Levels), Transformation of
questions from one Bloom’s Level to another and Generation of full assessments using inputs like syllabus, marking
scheme, average Bloom’s level and more.
• Conducted research by analyzing more than 21,000 questions from engineering question papers and developed a novel
process for generating assessments that test a wider variety of cognitive skills than current assessment techniques. The
research work led to a patent being published, and a research paper is also in the process of being published.
• This project is currently deployed live and is being used by some engineering colleges in Pune for assessment creation.

MindSync | NextJS, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, Gemini API, OCR, Speech to Text, Vercel, GitHub
April 2024 - Oct 2024
• Currently creating a web-based platform for creating mindmaps quickly and conveniently.
• Users can add any information - text (users can type or add text from a Word doc, PDF or PlainText file), images,
audio, video.
• Multimodal input options allow users to add textbooks, handwritten notes, video or audio lectures and convert
everything to a mindmap in a single click.
• All this can be accessed and used via an easy-to-use and modern web-application that is powered by NextJS,
TailwindCSS and MongoDB.
• The web platform allows users to save maps online, edit them completely online using code or even by simply sending
messages with the necessary changes and/or extra multi-modal information that they want to add to the mindmap.
• This project is currently in the Alpha phase and can be accessed at: mindsync.app

Other Projects | Various Skills/Tools
Completed
• Created a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Unreal Engine to explore game development. Also created some basic FPS Games
and worked on in-game AI.
• Created a full-stack bus-pass booking and ticket management system. Used Python, Flask, SQLite.

This project was initially created to manage events at a college, providing features for both attendance tracking and food
coupon management using QR-code based electronic passes.
• Worked on JalMitra, which was an idea for a mobile app that my team and I worked on for the Smart India Hackathon.
The app was meant to be a digital solution for water-related problem reporting and efficient management of issues along
with expenditure tracking and resource management. Included AI models for issue prioritization that could potentially
make administrative work easier and more efficient.
