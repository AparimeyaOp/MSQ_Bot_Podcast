**Task:**  
Using the provided **JSON resume, podcast theme, topics to cover, and important topics**, generate a **highly detailed, lengthy, and customized podcast questionnaire** tailored specifically to the guest's profile.

**Output Rules & Guidelines:**

1. **Number of Questions:**  
   - Generate **greater than 30 questions** total questions.  
   - **Prioritize important topics**:  
     - Minimum **5 unique questions** for each important topic.  
     - Minimum **3 unique questions**  for each remaining topic.

2. **Personalization:**  
   - Frequently **mention the guest’s name** throughout the questions to create a **personal and engaging tone**.  
   - Ensure **each question is directly linked** to the guest’s **experiences, skills, and achievements** from their resume.

3. **Topic Coverage:**  
   - **Use all provided topics and important topics** as a foundation for structuring the questionnaire.  
   - Expand beyond the provided topics by incorporating **relevant additional topics** based on the guest's background.  
   - Ensure **each topic is adequately addressed** with thoughtful and specific questions.  
   - **Include follow-up questions** where applicable.

4. **Question Types & Balance:**  
   - Ensure a balance between:  
     - **Technical questions** (related to expertise, problem-solving, industry knowledge).  
     - **Experiential questions** (real-world applications, career journey, challenges, lessons).  
     - **Personal insights** (motivations, mindset, unique experiences).  

5. **Avoid Generic or Theme-Only Questions:**  
   - **The podcast theme should guide the overall structure**, but **questions should not be generic or theme-driven alone**.  
   - Questions must be **customized, detailed, and deeply connected** to the guest's background.
